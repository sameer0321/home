        <p class="vs-f fw-400 color-black ff-Poppins opacity-07">At least 1.7 million Cambodians died and many more
            suffered
            during the Pol Pot regime of Democratic
            Kampuchea. From April 17, 1975 to January 6, 1979, the Khmer Rouge carried out a totalitarian communist
            regime that transformed Cambodian society in all areas, including the destruction of culture, traditions,
            languages, the killing of intellectuals, and the transformation of the country into a nation. A great
            agricultural economy. The revolution brought with it killings, overwork, starvation, disease, and family
            breakdown. The perpetrators of the genocide were senior cadres who carried out a strict secret service like
            Pol Pot and other top political cadres. This political system collapsed after the presence of the Vietnamese
            army in 1979.</p>
        <p class="vs-f fw-400 color-black ff-Poppins opacity-07">Prey Veng province has a high population density that
            was
            oppressed by the Khmer Rouge atrocities. The link
            between the US-Vietnam War and the military invasion caused great suffering. In addition, the assassination
            and forced evacuation of So Phim, the region's top commander, carried out a devastating agricultural reform
            plan during 1977. So Phim committed suicide in 1978 due to a dispute with the organization.</p>
